# The Turtle Crossing Capstone

Welcome to The Turtle Crossing Capstone repository! This project is developed as part of the 100 Days of Code challenge, specifically on Day 23. The Turtle Crossing Capstone is a fun and engaging game inspired by the classic arcade game Frogger, where players navigate a turtle across a busy road while avoiding obstacles.

## Description

The Turtle Crossing Capstone project brings the excitement of arcade gaming to your fingertips. In this game, players control a turtle as it attempts to cross a bustling road filled with cars, trucks, and other hazards. The goal is to safely guide the turtle to the other side without colliding with any obstacles.

## Features

- **Turtle Movement**: Control the turtle's movement using arrow keys or WASD keys.
- **Obstacle Generation**: Randomly generate obstacles, such as cars and trucks, that move across the screen at varying speeds.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your score based on the number of successful crossings.
- **Collision Detection**: Detect collisions between the turtle and obstacles, ending the game if a collision occurs.
- **Levels of Difficulty**: Increase the game's challenge by adjusting the speed and density of obstacles.
- **Game Over Screen**: Display a game over screen with the final score when the turtle fails to cross safely.
